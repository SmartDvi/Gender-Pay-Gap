Appendix notes:
Standard life has two employing entities in Ireland:
??The vast majority of people are employed by Standard Life Assets and Employee Services Limited.
??A small number of senior people (8 as of our snapshot date) are employed by Standard Life International DAC.
We believed that the fairest representation of our gender pay gap metrics was provided by reporting on the two entities
combined. However legally it is required that we report the separate metrics for Standard Life Assets and Employee Services
Limited, and accordingly, we set out those figures below. We are not reporting separately on Standard Life International,
as because of the small number of employees, there is no legal obligation to do so and privacy issues would arise"
